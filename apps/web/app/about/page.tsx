              RGAN XI was officially established on{" "}
              <strong>12 December 2023</strong> during the Gender and
              Development (GAD) Summit hosted by Davao Oriental State University
              in Mati City, Davao Oriental. With the theme{" "}
              <em>&ldquo;Beyond Gender Mainstreaming,&rdquo;</em> the summit
              convened gender and development advocates, higher education
              institutions, government agencies, researchers, educators, and
              development practitioners from across Region XI to strengthen
              collaboration and advance gender-responsive initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recognizing the need for a unified regional platform dedicated to
              research, policy, and advocacy on gender and development, summit
              participants initiated the creation of RGAN XI. Guided through the
              advisorship and support of the Commission on Higher Education
              Regional Office XI (CHED RO XI), the network was formally
              organized, and its founding officers were democratically elected
              during the summit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since its inception, RGAN XI has evolved into a dynamic regional
              network committed to advancing gender equality, diversity, equity,
              and social inclusion through interdisciplinary research, policy
              engagement, capacity building, and strategic partnerships. The
              organization serves as a hub for collaboration among higher
              education institutions, government agencies, civil society
              organizations, and other stakeholders working toward
              transformative and evidence-based gender and development programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, RGAN XI continues to champion innovation in gender
              scholarship and public policy while fostering partnerships that
              contribute to inclusive, equitable, and sustainable development in
              Region XI and beyond. Guided by its founding vision, the network
              remains steadfast in empowering institutions and communities to
              move beyond gender mainstreaming toward transformative gender
              justice and social change.
