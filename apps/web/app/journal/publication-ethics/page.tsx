              <p>
                Submitted manuscripts must represent original scholarly
                work. The journal screens all submissions using plagiarism
                detection software before peer review. The following
                constitute unacceptable publication practices: plagiarism,
                self-plagiarism without proper citation, duplicate
                publication, redundant publication, mosaic plagiarism,
                translated plagiarism, and unattributed use of text,
                figures, tables, or ideas. Proper quotation, citation, and
                acknowledgment of previously published work are mandatory.
                The Editorial Board reserves the right to reject manuscripts
                or retract published articles found to contain plagiarism or
                other forms of academic misconduct.

              <p>
                Authors shall not submit substantially similar manuscripts
                to more than one journal simultaneously. The journal does
                not accept manuscripts that have already been published,
                substantially overlap with previously published work, have
                been divided into multiple publications without scientific
                justification (&quot;salami publication&quot;), or
                constitute duplicate publication. Any overlap with
                previously disseminated work, including conference
                proceedings, dissertations, or preprints, must be fully
                disclosed at submission.

                available whenever ethically and legally possible. Each
                manuscript should include a Data Availability Statement

              <p>
                Research involving human participants must comply with
                internationally accepted ethical standards, including the
                Declaration of Helsinki and relevant national regulations.
                Authors must indicate the approving ethics committee or IRB,
                approval or protocol number (where applicable), confirmation
                that informed consent was obtained, and additional
                safeguards for vulnerable populations. Personally
                identifiable information shall not be published unless
                scientifically justified, explicit written consent has been
                obtained, and publication complies with applicable data
                protection laws. Research involving animals must comply with
                institutional, national, and international ethical
                standards governing animal welfare, with evidence of ethical
                approval provided.

              <p>
                AI technologies may assist authors during manuscript
                preparation provided their use is transparent, responsible,
                and does not compromise research integrity — for example,
                language editing, grammar improvement, formatting
                assistance, coding assistance, data visualization support,
                and literature organization. Authors remain fully
                responsible for all content generated with AI assistance. AI
                tools shall not be listed as authors, assume responsibility
                for the manuscript, replace scientific interpretation,
                fabricate references or data, or generate misleading
                scientific conclusions. All substantial AI assistance must
                be disclosed in an AI Use Declaration.

            <PolicySection title="Authorship, Conflicts of Interest, and Funding">
              <p>
                Authorship should accurately reflect substantial scholarly
                contributions, following the ICMJE authorship
                recommendations. Each submission must include an Author
                Contributions Statement using the CRediT (Contributor Roles
                Taxonomy). Guest, honorary, gift, and ghost authorship are
                considered unethical and are prohibited.
              </p>
              <p>
                Authors must disclose all financial, institutional,
                personal, professional, or political relationships that
                could reasonably influence the interpretation of their
                research, and must disclose all funding sources supporting
                the research, including the funding organization, grant
                number(s), and the funder&apos;s role in the study.

            <PolicySection title="Citation Integrity, Peer Review Manipulation, and Image Integrity">
              <p>
                Authors should cite literature fairly, accurately, and
                appropriately; citation practices intended solely to
                manipulate citation metrics — such as excessive
                self-citation, coercive citation, or citation cartels — are
                prohibited. Any attempt to manipulate the peer-review
                process, including fabricated reviewer identities or
                improperly influencing reviewers, constitutes serious
                misconduct. Figures, photographs, and graphical materials
                must accurately represent the original data; manipulation
                intended to deceive readers is strictly prohibited.

                All allegations of research or publication misconduct shall
                be investigated fairly, confidentially, and in accordance
                with COPE guidance. Depending on the nature of the
                allegation, the journal may request explanations from
                authors, obtain original data, consult independent experts,
                contact the authors&apos; institutions, suspend editorial
                processing, publish corrections, issue expressions of
                concern, retract published articles, or prohibit future
                submissions for a specified period. All decisions are based
